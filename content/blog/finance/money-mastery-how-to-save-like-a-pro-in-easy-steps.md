### Understanding Your Financial Position

*Assessing Income and Expenses*

Start by taking a thorough look at your income versus your expenses. This will give you a clear picture of where your money is going and where you can start saving.

### Identifying Financial Goals

What are your financial goals? Whether it's buying a house, going on a vacation, or building a retirement fund, having clear goals can motivate you to save.

A budget is a roadmap for your finances. Creating a budget helps you understand how much you can spend and save each month.

High-interest debt can hinder your ability to save. Develop a plan to pay off debt, starting with the highest interest rates first.
